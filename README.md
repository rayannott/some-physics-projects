# Watch Accuracy

Recently I bought a Hamilton Khaki Field Automatic watch. I was curious about its accuracy, so I decided to measure it. I used an audio recorder on my phone to record the watch's ticking sound (for ~1 minute) and then I analyzed the recording to measure the actual time between ticks.
